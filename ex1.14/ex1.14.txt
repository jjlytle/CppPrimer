Exercise 1.14: Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those using a while. 
Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?

With a for loop the index update is know to happen at just before
the conditional test.
With the for loop the index has local scope. this could be an advantage or disadvantage.
the while loop is more flexible on when the index is updated
the for loop has all relevant information in the header so it could be easier to read
when skimming code.
it is easier to forget to update the index in a while loop with the effect
that the conditional test always compares the same values.
