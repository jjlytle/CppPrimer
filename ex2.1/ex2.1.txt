Exercise 2.1: What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short? 
Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

the difference between short int long, and long is the minimum number of bit used to represent
the type in memory

the difference between an unsigned an signed type is signed values can be positive and negative.
where as unsigned values can only be positive, because a type is restricted to a certain number of bits
signed types split the range evenly between positive and negative values. I.E 8 bit unsigned can represent
the values 0 to 255 where signed usually represents -128 to 127. both ranges contain 255 distinct values.

a float is a real number represented with single precision floating point 
a double is a real number represented with double precision floating point.
single and double precision floating point is just a way to represent real numbers
using binary defined by IEEE x.x.x as a type is limited to a certain number of bits so 
decimal precision can not be infinite like pi.
