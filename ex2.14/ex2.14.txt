Exercise 2.14: Is the following program legal? If so, what values are
printed?

int i = 100, 
sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i) 
sum += i;
std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl; 


Answer: it is legal. the value printed are 100 45 as i the i that 
was equal to 10 went out of scope and the global i variable is still in scope
