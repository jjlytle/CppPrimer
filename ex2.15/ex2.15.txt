Exercise 2.15: Which of the following definitions, if any, are invalid? Why?
(a) int ival = 1.01;
(b) int &rval1 = 1.01;
(c) int &rval2 = ival;
(d) int &rval3;

(a) int ival = 1.01;
    valid
(b) int &rval1 = 1.01;
    invalid must reference an object not a literal
(c) int &rval2 = ival;
    valid
(d) int &rval3;
    invalid reference must be initialized to an object.
