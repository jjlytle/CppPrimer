Exercise 2.21: Explain each of the following definitions. 
Indicate whether any are illegal and, if so, why.
int i = 0;
  
(a) double* dp = &i;  a double pointer can't point to an int address.
(b) int *ip = i; this would be a really crap way of doing a null pointer, but you can't initialize a 
    int* with an int.
(c) int *p = &i; this is the correct way to point to i.
