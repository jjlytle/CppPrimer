Exercise 2.25: Determine the types and values of each of the following
variables.
(a) int* ip, &r = ip; 
(b) int i, *ip = 0; 
(c) int* ip, ip2;

(a) int* ip, &r = ip; r is a reference to a int pointer
(b) int i, *ip = 0;  i is int declaration ip is dereferenced and what ip points to is assigned zero.
(c) int* ip, ip2; ip is an int pointer and ip2 is a int, both a declarations
