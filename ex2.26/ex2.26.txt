Exercise 2.26: Which of the following are legal? For those that are illegal,
explain why.
(a) const int buf;
(b) int cnt = 0;
(c) const int sz = cnt; (d) ++cnt; ++sz;

(a) const int buf; defines a read-only int named buf
(b) int cnt = 0; define an int called count and initializes it to 0.
(c) const int sz = cnt; defines a read-only int sz and 
    initializes it to zero by use of the cnt variable
(d) ++cnt; ++sz; this is illegal as ++sz is attempting to write to the read=only variable sz.
