Exercise 2.27: Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why. 
(a) int i = -1, &r = 0; //illegal as r is not a constant reference
(b) int *const p2 = &i2; //would be legal if i2 i an int but is not been declared
(c) const int i = -1, &r = 0; // legal as a const int reference must be initialized and can be to a literal
(d) const int *const p3 = &i2; //same as second example above
(e) const int *p1 = &i2; // would be legal if i2 is a constant int
(f) const int &const r2; // illegal as a reference must be initialized
(g) const int i2 = i, &r = i; //legal as long as i is an object
