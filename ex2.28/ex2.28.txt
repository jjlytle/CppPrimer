Exercise 2.28: Explain the following definitions. Identify any that are illegal. 

(a) int i, *const cp;
(b) int *p1, *const p2;
(c) const int ic, &r = ic; 
(d) const int *const p3;
(e) const int *p;


(a) int i, *const cp; //illegal declaration of int i and a constant pointer to int needs to be initialized
(b) int *p1, *const p2; //illegal declaration of a pointer to int ans a constant pointer to int needs to be initialized
(c) const int ic, &r = ic; //illegal declaration to a constant int needs to be initialized and a reference to a constant int
(d) const int *const p3; //illegal declaration of a constant pointer to a constant int needs to be initialized
(e) const int *p; //declaration of a pointer to a constant int
