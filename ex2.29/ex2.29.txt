Exercise 2.29: Using the variables in the previous exercise, which of the
following assignments are legal? Explain why.

int i, *const cp;
int *p1, *const p2;
const int ic, &r = ic; 
const int *const p3;
const int *p;

(a) i = ic; //illegal as ic need to be initialized before being assigned to i
(b) p1 = p3; //a value of type "const int *" cannot be assigned to an entity of type "int *"
(c) p1 = &ic; //a value of type "const int *" cannot be assigned to an entity of type "int *"
(d) p3 = &ic; //expression must be a modifiable lvalue
(e) p2 = p1; //expression must be a modifiable lvalue
(f) ic = *p3; //expression must be a modifiable lvalue
