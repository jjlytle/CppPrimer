Exercise 2.33: Using the variable definitions from this section, determine
what happens in each of these assignments:

a=42; 
b=42; 
c=42; 
d=42; 
e=42; 
g=42;


    a=42; //a is an int
    b=42; //b is a int
    c=42; //c is a int
    d=42; //d is an int pointer so illegal assignment
    e=42; // e is const int* so illegal assignment
    g=42; //g is a const int reference that is bound  to ci can't be redefined
