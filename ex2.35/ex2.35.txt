Exercise 2.35: Determine the types deduced in each of the 
following definitions. Once youâ€™ve figured out the types, 
write a program to see whether you were correct.


const int i = 42; 
auto j = i; //int
const auto &k = i; //const int
auto *p = &i;  // const int*
const auto j2 = i, &k2 = i; //const int, const int
