Exercise 2.38: Describe the differences in type deduction between 
decltype and auto. Give an example of an expression where auto and 
decltype will deduce the same type and an example where 
they will deduce differing types.


auto assigns the variable the type returned by the rvalue expression
decltype returns the type of the function passed to it.

int i = 0;
int* p = &i;
auto a = p;
decltype(p) b = p;
