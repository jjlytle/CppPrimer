Exercise 2.5: Determine the type of each of the following literals. Explain
the differences among the literals in each of the four examples: 
(a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a"
(b) 10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 012, 0xC
(c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L
(d) 10, 10u, 10., 10e-2


(a) 
    'a' is const char, 
    L'a' is const wchar_t
    "a" is a string meaning an array containing char 'a' and char '\0' and returns a char* to 'a'
    L"a" the same as above but instead of char's they are wchar_t
(b) 
    10 is int 
    10u is unsigned int 
    10L is long
    10uL is unsigned long 
    012 is int in octal 12 or 10 in decimal 
    0xC is int in hex or 12 in decimal
(c) 
    3.14 is double
    3.14f is float
    3.14L is long double
(d) 
    10 is int
    10u is unsigned int
    10. is double
    10e-2 is double
