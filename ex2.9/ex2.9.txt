Exercise 2.9: Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal,
explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.
(a) std::cin >> int input_value;
(b) int i = { 3.14 };
(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
(d) int i = 3.14;


(a) std::cin >> int input_value;
    must be decaled before cin attempts to assign value.
    error: expected '(' for function-style cast or type construction
(b) int i = { 3.14 };
    using list initialization to assigning a float to an int is an warning due to loss of precision
    warning: implicit conversion from 'double' to 'int' changes value from 3.14 to 3 [-Wliteral-conversion]  
(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
    attempting to assign wage to salary before wage is initialized 
    error: use of undeclared identifier 'wage'
(d) int i = 3.14;
